Good question!  
When it says:

```bash
export MPJ_HOME=/path/to/mpj
```

you need to replace `/path/to/mpj` with **the actual location where you unpacked MPJ Express**.

For example:  
- If you unpacked it into your home folder `/home/yourname/mpj-v0_44/`, then:

```bash
export MPJ_HOME=/home/yourname/mpj-v0_44
```

Or if you unpacked it somewhere else, use that path.

---

Quick way to find the path:  
- Go into the folder where you extracted it.
- Type `pwd` (print working directory) in terminal.
- That printed output is your `/path/to/mpj`.

**Example full setup:**

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xvzf mpj-v0_44.tar.gz
export MPJ_HOME=/home/yourname/Downloads/mpj-v0_44
export PATH=$MPJ_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

Want me to show you a 30-second script you could use to automate it too? ðŸ”¥

Steps to Run:
Create the Java Files:

Create two separate Java files on your system:

MachineA.java

MachineB.java

Compile the Java Files: Open a terminal in the directory where your Java files are located, and run the following commands to compile both files.

bash
Copy
Edit
javac MachineA.java
javac MachineB.java
This will generate MachineA.class and MachineB.class files in the same directory.

Run the Server (MachineA):

Start the MachineA program first, as it is the server that will wait for the token.

Open a terminal window and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
java MachineA
This will start the server and wait for an incoming connection. It will print out messages like "Received token" and "Releasing token" when the token is received and sent back.

Run the Client (MachineB):

Open another terminal window and run the MachineB program:

bash
Copy
Edit
java MachineB
This will start Machine B and simulate it getting the token, entering the critical section, and passing the token to Machine A.

Explanation:
MachineA.java is the server that listens for the token and releases it after holding it for 10 seconds.

MachineB.java is the client that initially has the token and enters the critical section. It then passes the token back after the critical section is finished.
